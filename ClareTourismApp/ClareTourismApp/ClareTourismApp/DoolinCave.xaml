At 7.3 metres (23feet) it is the longest free-hanging stalactite in Europe. The Great Stalactite, suspended from the ceiling like a chandelier, is truly astounding. Visitors can hardly believe that it was formed from a single drop of water over thousands of years."

It's mind boggling how many years it took to form the stalactite and how much work it took a few people to make this accessible to the average person. We had a very knowledgeable tour guide who made sure to point out fossils of prehistoric worms on the way down and other interesting features. How any times in your life will you be able to walk deep into a cave and marvel at mother nature? It's well worth a visit'"
